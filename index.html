<h1><font color="white">Where to Go</font></h1>
<p><font color="white">We are not yet a regular company, so we created this unformal link just for the submission form.
As for the mobile application. First we have made an agreement with bars and nightclubs in order collect their music playlist. After that, we just need Spotify Web API, especially the “GET audio features”, in order to have specific characteristics for each track of the playlist.
</font></p>

<p><font color="white">Then, we just create a “music profile” for each bar or nightclub, which is visible to all users, in order to help them find the suitable place for them.
Our business plan for now is to charge each place at a low cost.
We don’t have users, or ready mock-up because we are at developing process.
We have tried your services on a free trial and we were very satisfied, so the main purpose of this submission is to ask if we can use Spotify (with that usecase) for commercial use and what is the price.
For further details, contact with the given e-mail.

<p><font color="white">Thank you in advance</font></p>
